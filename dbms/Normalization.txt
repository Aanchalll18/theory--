‚úÖ What is Normalization?
"Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity."

üí° Benefits of Normalization:

1>Reduces data redundancy.
2>Improves data consistency and integrity.
3>Makes data maintenance easier.

‚úÖ What is 1NF (First Normal Form)?
A table is in First Normal Form (1NF) if:

1>All attributes (columns) contain only atomic (indivisible) values.

2>Each record (row) is uniquely identifiable, usually by a primary key.

‚úÖ What is 2NF (Second Normal Form)?
A table is in 2NF if:

It is in 1NF, and
All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key, not just a part of it.

‚úÖ What is 3NF (Third Normal Form)?
Definition:
A table is in 3NF if:

It is in 2NF, and

There is no transitive dependency between non-key attributes.

‚ö†Ô∏è A transitive dependency occurs when a non-prime attribute depends on another non-prime attribute, rather than directly on the primary key.

‚úÖ What is BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)?
Definition:
A table is in BCNF if:

It is in 3NF, and
For every functional dependency X ‚Üí Y, X is a superkey.
In simpler terms, every determinant must be a candidate key.

Why BCNF?
Sometimes, even tables in 3NF may have anomalies if there are multiple candidate keys with overlapping attributes. BCNF is a stricter form of 3NF that resolves such issues.

Denormalization is the process of combining tables to improve query performance, often by introducing redundancy.
