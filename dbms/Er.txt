An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the entities, their attributes,and the relations between those entities providing a clear blueprint for designing the database structure before actual development.

#Extended ER:
The Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) model is an enhanced version of the traditional ER model that includes advanced features like specialization, generalization, and aggregation. These features help in modeling complex and real-world databases more precisely by capturing hierarchical relationships and constraints that the basic ER model cannot represent effectively. The EER model is especially useful in designing databases that require inheritance and abstraction

✅ 1. Specialization:
Definition:
Specialization is the process of dividing a higher-level entity into two or more lower-level sub-entities based on some distinguishing characteristics.

Example:
A general entity Employee can be specialized into Technician, and Manager based on job roles.

✅ 2. Generalization:
Definition:
Generalization is the reverse of specialization. It combines two or more lower-level entities into a higher-level generalized entity that captures common attributes.

Example:
Entities like Car and Truck can be generalized into a higher-level entity Vehicle that holds common attributes like registration_number, engine_number.

✅ 3. Aggregation:
Definition:
Aggregation is a concept where a relationship itself is treated as a higher-level entity. It is used when we need to express a relationship between a relationship and another entity.

Example:
If Employee works on a Project, and we need to assign a Manager to oversee this work relationship, the works_on relationship is aggregated and linked to Manager.
