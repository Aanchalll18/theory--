 advantages
  Ensures that the data is accurate and consistent.

  Provides controlled access to sensitive data by setting permissions for different users.

   Avoids duplicate data by enforcing normalization.

✅ What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
Answer:
DBMS (Database Management System) stores data without enforcing relationships between data. It’s suitable for small-scale applications and lacks support for complex querying.

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) stores data in tables with defined relationships using primary and foreign keys. It enforces data integrity, supports normalization, and is widely used in enterprise applications.

✅ Q: What are the different types of DBMS?

Hierarchical DBMS: Data is organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships

Network DBMS: Data is represented as a graph with many-to-many relationships. 

Relational DBMS (RDBMS): Data is organized in tables (relations) and managed through SQL.

Object-Oriented DBMS: Data is stored as objects, like in object-oriented programming
